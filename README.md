# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

Welcome to this interactive learning session on data structures and algorithms using Python. Here, we will explore various data structures and algorithms, understand their concepts, and implement them with practical examples.

## Roadmap

We will cover the following topics in order:

1.  **Introduction to Data Structures**
2.  **Big O Notation**
3.  **Arrays**
4.  **Linked Lists**
    *   Singly Linked Lists
    *   Doubly Linked Lists
5.  **Stacks**
6.  **Queues**
7.  **Trees**
    *   Binary Trees
    *   Binary Search Trees (BSTs)
    *   AVL Trees
8.  **Heaps**
    *   Min-Heap
    *   Max-Heap
9.  **Hash Tables**
10. **Graphs**
    *   Graph Representation (Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix)
    *   Graph Traversal (BFS, DFS)

Let's begin our journey!
